## Brand Positioning

**Tone:** Credible, authoritative, in-demand
**Feel:** Professional expertise with approachable warmth
**Impression:** Modern executive presence — the trusted advisor clients seek out

---

## Color Palette

| Role | Color | Hex Code | When to Use |
|------|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Primary Background** | Warm Off-White | `#FAFAF8` | Main content areas, body sections |
| **Secondary** | Deep Navy | `#0F172A` | Hero section, CTA blocks, visual "bookends" |
| **Accent** | Sky Blue | `#0EA5E9` | Buttons, links, highlights, icons |
| **Text (light bg)** | Dark Charcoal | `#1A1A1A` | Body copy on white/off-white |
| **Text (dark bg)** | White | `#FFFFFF` | Headlines and text on navy sections |

**Usage Pattern:** Dark navy "bookends" the site — bold hero at top, call-to-action section before footer. White/off-white content sections in between create breathing room.

## Typography

| Purpose | Font | Style |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Headlines** | Lora | Serif, warm and authoritative |
| **Body Text** | Nunito | Sans-serif, clean and approachable |

This pairing balances credibility (serif headlines convey gravitas) with accessibility (rounded sans-serif body text feels welcoming).

**For print materials:** Use Lora for headlines/titles and Nunito for body copy. Both are Google Fonts, freely available.

## Visual Style Summary

- **Corners:** Subtle rounding (4-8px) — not sharp, not pill-shaped
- **Cards:** White with soft shadows, lift slightly on hover
- **Photography:** Professional portrait, contained framing with subtle shadow
- **Spacing:** Compact but not cramped — efficient use of space
